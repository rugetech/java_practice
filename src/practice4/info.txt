Timeout popup: Connection problem or invalid MMI code
Starting popup: (After code Entered) USSD code running

the idea keep growing everytime i accomplish a certain step on this project.
which feels great...

Instead of just string variables, I will do string arraylist, and the output to be input minus 1.
then use string split method to split the first number/word before space. and print the rest plus word 'MENU'

then if above tasks are I'll create 8 classes for each menu and put their choice in each.

God help me.

UPDATE
I had to study array, string methods
how to avoid repetition of code (I am lazy)
